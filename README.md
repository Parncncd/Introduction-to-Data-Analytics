# Introduction to Data Analytics
<br>
A course I enrolled in Junior year ðŸŽ“
<br><br>

* [Regression Analysis Assignment](https://github.com/chananchida-srithongdee/introduction-to-data-analytics/tree/main/RegressionAnalysis)
  using 
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - seaborn to do data exploration
   - matplotlib to do data exploration
   - scikit-learn to train the model
      - train-test split
      - LinearRegression 

* [Classification Analysis Assignment](https://github.com/chananchida-srithongdee/introduction-to-data-analytics/tree/main/ClassificationAnalysis)
  using 
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - scikit-learn 
      - train-test split and k-fold Cross Validation
        > I tried both of these methods to split data to see which one would give a better performance
      - DecisionTree, LogisticRegression, GaussianNB (Naive Bayes), KNeighborsClassifier, and MLPClassifier (Neural network)
        > I tried all of these classifiers to train the model, <br>the best model for <ins>dataset C</ins> was the one that use <br>**KNeighborsClassifier (k=5)** and splitted data by using **train-test split with test-size = 0.2** and for <ins>dataset D</ins> I used **train-test split with test-size = 0.2** and then used **LogisticRegression** as a classifier.
